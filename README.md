# PoseNet

## Overview
PoseNet is a real-time human pose estimation system that detects key points on a personâ€™s body using deep learning techniques. This project is designed for applications such as motion tracking, fitness analysis, augmented reality, and more.

## Features
- Real-time pose estimation
- Detects key points such as eyes, nose, shoulders, elbows, knees, and more
- Works with both images and live video feeds
- Lightweight and efficient for real-time performance
- Can be integrated with other applications like gesture recognition or activity monitoring

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PoseNet.git
   cd PoseNet
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the required model weights (if applicable) and place them in the designated directory.

## Usage
To run pose estimation on an image:
```bash
python pose_estimation.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

To run real-time pose estimation using a webcam:
```bash
python pose_estimation.py --webcam
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
